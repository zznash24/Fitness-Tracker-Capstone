# Fitness-Tracker-Capstone
The Workout Zone is built for anyone and everyone to have access to proper exercise instruction without the cost of a gym membership or a coach.  It was built using React, Node, Express, Sequelize, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a little blood and sweat!

Features:
    - Customisable search function built with an HTTP request system that uses Fetch, connected to an       endpoint on the ExerciseDB API hosted on RapidAPI to allow users to search for exercise data.
    - Save feature that will save any selected result. 
    - Animated exercise demonstrations.
    - Full data pagination to break up results into multiple pages.
    - Responsive mobile-first design created using the MUI styling library.

Users are able to:
    - Search for exercise info and animated demonstrations by name, target muscle or equipment used.
    - Create a userId and login to access all saved exercises by toggling the sitesâ€™ display mode.
    - Remove favourites from the favs list or from the results list itself.
